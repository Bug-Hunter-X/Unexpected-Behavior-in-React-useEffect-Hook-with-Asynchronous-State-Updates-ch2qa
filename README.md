# React useEffect Hook Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the `useEffect` hook in React with asynchronous state updates. The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of `setCount`, leading to potential race conditions and unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` to update a count variable every second. However, due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React, the count variable might not be updated correctly, leading to unexpected results.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that state updates are handled correctly by optimizing the update logic within the `useEffect` hook. This might involve using functional updates or other techniques to prevent race conditions and ensure the count variable is incremented accurately.
